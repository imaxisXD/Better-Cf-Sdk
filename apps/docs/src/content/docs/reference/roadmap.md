description: Directional roadmap for future better-cf surface areas.
---

This roadmap is directional, not a release contract.

## Current Focus

- stabilize queue DX and scanner reliability
- improve docs coverage with source-backed examples
- keep generated wiring predictable across supported Wrangler configs

## Reserved Future Namespaces

- `better-cf/workflow`
- `better-cf/durable-object`

## Principles for Future Additions

- opinionated defaults first
- preserve direct Cloudflare escape hatches
- prioritize maintainable DX over thin wrapper sprawl

## What Is Not Implied

Reserved namespaces do not imply immediate availability or timeline guarantees.
